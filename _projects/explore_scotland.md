Explore Scotland is a group project I did in my second semester as part of my Internet Technology course. It is a web application which aims to provide parents with a fun new way to educate their kids about Scotland's historical and cultural heritage. It allows parents to set up profiles for their children and use the application to track their children's progress. Kids can use the profiles set up by their parents to access the main educational tool which gradually teaches them various facts regarding Scotland. It also has periodical quizzes that probe the kids' acquired knowledge. They serve to check whether kids are ready to progress onto the next level which unlocks more educational material.

The project's backend is implemented with the _Django_ framework which was my main responsibility during development. We also used _HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Maps API_ to realise the project. Carrying out this project gave me insight into the challenges of web development. I learned about transforming an idea into a viable product in a limited amount of time by using appropriate techniques, such as requirements gathering, user personas, wireframes, site mapping and others. I also got valuable experience about software projects done in teams and the dynamics involved.

The web application is hosted on PythonAnywhere and can be viewed [here](http://explorescotland.pythonanywhere.com/).
