<br><br>Hello and welcome to my personal corner of the Internet!    


My name is **Boyan** and I have a passion for technology and building software. I am due to graduate from the University of Glasgow in November with a _MSc in Software Development_ and I am currently looking for opportunities to develop my skills further in a professional environment.

You can read my thoughts on various things that interest me in my  [blog](/blog/), view the [projects](/projects/) I have worked on or see some of my [photography](/photography/).
