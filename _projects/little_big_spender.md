Little Big Spender is my individual summer project as part of my MSc in Software Development. I was curious about mobile app development and having bought an Android phone recently, I thought it's perfect to develop an Android application for my project. It was my biggest software development challenge at the time. I had to learn independently an entirely new framework to a level where I was able to deliver a working product.

The app is a money management app that supports cryptocurrencies as an asset and means of payment which I developed over a period of about 2 months, including time to learn the Android framework. I also conducted a usability study among 18 participants to evaluate the system and wrote a report on the project.

The project sparked my interest in Android development and I am very keen on making this my primary focus. While the project gave me insight into bringing a concept of a system to the prototype stage, I am looking forward to expanding this in the near future to a stage where I have an app that is deployed to the PlayStore.
