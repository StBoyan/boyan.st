This is the first project I have undertaken after finishing university. The aim was to create a website where I can showcase what I am up to, share my thoughts and my passion for photography.

It is made with [_Jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com/) as it integrates nicely with GitHub Pages and once set up allows me to easily add new content. My experience with Django was particularly useful in helping me learn Jekyll's template language. This project helped me reinforce my _HTML_ and _CSS_ skills and also introduced me to _SCSS_.
